# 2019-final-project-remix
This is a simple project to study an application of Contract Factory. A Factory is a contract that creates other contracts.

User Stories: How to prove that your degree or certificate is true?hot to prevent false certificates? Istitutions, Schools or Universities can register details of degrees using CertificateFactory to create contracts for their students. Only the Istitutions can create it, because they are the owners of CertificateFactory.

There are dev bootcamp's students with more experience than me. Thanks for your pacience. I can evaluate your projects.

Unfurtunately i have not made a front end interface. Sorry. But you can compile and run a simplified solidity version code with remix: 



1) Start Ganache at 8545 port.
2) open remix.ethereum.org
3) copy the code ( the code is in the file CertificateContract.sol file )
4) in remix: select compile and "select new compiler version" version 0.5.0. 
5) Select CertificateFactory and click Compile
6) Select Run, Environment and choose Web3provider. 
7)in Run page, select CertificateFactory and click Deploy.

note: in the contract, insert date in this form ddmmyyyy, only number.
